1. First inside your Django app -> define `models.py` 
   # Create and define your models in the `models.py` file.

2. Make sure you have installed apps listed.
   # Ensure your app is included in the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in `settings.py`.

3. So register now those models inside `<your-app>` -> `admin.py` file
   # Register your models in the `admin.py` file to make them accessible via the Django admin interface.

4. `python manage.py makemigrations <app-name>`
   # Generate migration files based on your model definitions.

5. `python manage.py migrate`
   # Apply the migrations to update the database schema.

6. `python manage.py runserver`
   # Start the development server to view your application.
